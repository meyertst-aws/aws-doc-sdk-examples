# Metadata generation for ECR repositories
The files in this directory are used to generate text that is manually copied into our 
[ECR CDK stack file](resources/cdk/ecr_repositories/ecr_repositories-stack.ts) which is 
used as the source config file for our ECR repositories.

This is not example code and is used internally by the AWS team responsible for maintaining 
this repository.
