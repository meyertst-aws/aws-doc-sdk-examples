# Amazon SNS code examples for the SDK for Python

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

*Amazon SNS is a web service that enables applications, end-users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?aws-products-pricing.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-pricing.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Type=*all&awsf.tech-category=*all) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `python` folder.

Install the packages required by these examples by running the following in a virtual environment:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a topic](sns_basics.py#L31) (`CreateTopic`)
* [Delete a subscription](sns_basics.py#L152) (`Unsubscribe`)
* [Delete a topic](sns_basics.py#L66) (`DeleteTopic`)
* [List the subscribers of a topic](sns_basics.py#L108) (`ListSubscriptions`)
* [List topics](sns_basics.py#L49) (`ListTopics`)

* [Set a filter policy](sns_basics.py#L130) (`SetSubscriptionAttributes`)
* [Subscribe an email address to a topic](sns_basics.py#L80) (`Subscribe`)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

* [Create and publish to a FIFO topic](sns_fifo_topic.py)

### Cross-service examples

Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

* [Create an Amazon Textract explorer application](../../cross_service/textract_explorer)
