# Amazon S3 code examples for the SDK for C++ using S3Client

## Overview

The code examples in this directory demonstrate how to work with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using the
AWS SDK for C++.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and
performance.

This example uses the S3Client, which is a fully-featured Amazon S3 interface and is ideally suited for smaller files.
For other classes provided by the AWS SDK for C++ that also interface to Amazon S3, see example
folder [s3-crt](../s3-crt) and example folder [transfer-manager](../transfer-manager).

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform
  the task. For more information,
  see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  .
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information,
  see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.
- [Create, list, and delete S3 buckets](./s3_getting_started_scenario.cpp)
- [Find, create, and delete an S3 bucket in a sequence](./s3_demo_for_cloud9.cpp)

## Run the examples

Before using the code examples, first complete the installation and setup steps
of [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html) in the AWS SDK for
C++ Developer Guide.
This section covers how to get and build the SDK, and how to build your own code by using the SDK with a
sample Hello World-style application.

Next, for information on code example structures and how to build and run the examples, see [Getting started with the AWS SDK for C++ code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started-code-examples.html).

## Tests

⚠️ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

```sh
   cd <BUILD_DIR>
   cmake <path-to-root-of-this-source-code> -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
   make
   ctest 
   ./gtests/s3_gtest 
```
